                <h2>About the CEO of Daryl Tech</h2>
                <p>
                    While relaxing under the African sun, I envisioned a future where technology bridges continents. 
                    That vision became Daryl Tech - born from a dream to make professional web development accessible to everyone. 
                    What started as a simple idea is now growing into a platform that empowers businesses across Zimbabwe and beyond.
                    Today, we're building that future one website at a time.
